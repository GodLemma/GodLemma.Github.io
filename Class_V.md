### DNA-seq Analysis
- C value paradox of genome size versus organismal complexity
  - For example,human:3.2Gb and about 1Gb pseudogenes
  - GC content varies: in becteria, may caused by different temperature of living environment

- Genomic features of humman genome
  - contents: repeats and translocon, intron, coding sequence, regulotary sequence
  - Segmental duplication and copy number variants
  - GAWS

- gff/gtf vs bed format
  - bed format use 0 as begin of a genome
  - bed format has different sequence of information
